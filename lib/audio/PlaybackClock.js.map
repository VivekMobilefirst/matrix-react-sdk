This clock is tightly coupled with the operation\n * of the Playback class, making assumptions about how the provided\n * AudioContext will be used (suspended/resumed to preserve time, etc).\n *\n * But why do we need a clock? The AudioContext exposes time information,\n * and so does the audio buffer, but not in a way that is useful for humans\n * to perceive. The audio buffer time is often lagged behind the context\n * time due to internal processing delays of the audio API. Additionally,\n * the context's time is tracked from when it was first initialized/started,\n * not related to positioning within the clip. However, the context time\n * is the most accurate time we can use to determine position within the\n * clip if we're fast enough to track the pauses and stops.\n *\n * As a result, we track every play, pause, stop, and seek event from the\n * Playback class (kinda: it calls us, which is close enough to the same\n * thing). These events are then tracked on the AudioContext time scale,\n * with assumptions that code execution will result in negligible desync\n * of the clock, or at least no perceptible difference in time. It's\n * extremely important that the calling code, and the clock's own code,\n * is extremely fast between the event happening and the clock time being\n * tracked - anything more than a dozen milliseconds is likely to stack up\n * poorly, leading to clock desync.\n *\n * Clock desync can be dangerous for the stability of the playback controls:\n * if the clock thinks the user is somewhere else in the clip, it could\n * inform the playback of the wrong place in time, leading to dead air in\n * the output or, if severe enough, a clock that won't stop running while\n * the audio is paused/stopped. Other examples include the clip stopping at\n * 90% time due to playback ending, the clip playing from the wrong spot\n * relative to the time, and negative clock time.\n *\n * Note that the clip duration is fed to the clock: this is to ensure that\n * we have the most accurate time possible to present.\n */\nexport class PlaybackClock implements IDestroyable {\n    private clipStart = 0;\n    private stopped = true;\n    private lastCheck = 0;\n    private observable = new SimpleObservable<number[]>();\n    private timerId: number;\n    private clipDuration = 0;\n    private placeholderDuration = 0;\n\n    public constructor(private context: AudioContext) {\n    }\n\n    public get durationSeconds(): number {\n        return this.clipDuration || this.placeholderDuration;\n    }\n\n    public set durationSeconds(val: number) {\n        this.clipDuration = val;\n        this.observable.update([this.timeSeconds, this.clipDuration]);\n    }\n\n    public get timeSeconds(): number {\n        // The modulo is to ensure that we're only looking at the most recent clip\n        // time, as the context is long-running and multiple plays might not be\n        // informed to us (if the control is looping, for example).
